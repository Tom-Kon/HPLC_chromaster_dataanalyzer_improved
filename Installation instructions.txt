KU Leuven IT is not so fond of custom user scripts, so we need to bypass some permissions. To install the software: 

1. Copy HPLCDataAnalyze-Installer.exe to the GBW_MyDownloads folder like you're normally supposed to do for downloads. 
2. Run it from there. 
3. Always install for all users. You'll need administrator permissions to do so, via the admin tool on your desktop.
